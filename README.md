# SecureDownloadPlugin

This plugin is inspired by [mod_secdownload](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/lighttpd-mod_secdownload-configuration.html) of Lighttpd.
It creates a secure download area only accessible via unique download URLs that only remain valid for a specified time. This is most
convenient when protecting downloadable resources with a registration form that has to be filled out before access to them is granted.
